# pyOhm

## Why?

Just for fun and learning some Python feat. TK interface. As I'm vaping and building coils, I have to know what current the build is draining from the batteries or how I have to build a coil/wick an atomizer so it fit's my needs.

## How?

I created a class "Ohm" the does all the caluculation. And I created a GUI using Tk-widgets like Label, Entry and Button. On button click or return the class "Ohm" is used to calculate the missing values.

Have fun with it. Ideas or questions are welcome.

Vape on and vape safe,
